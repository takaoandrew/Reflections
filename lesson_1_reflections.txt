What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros are being able to choose logically when you want a new commit.
Cons are user error, like forgetting to save or saving accidentally.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because it would add a lot of complexity for Google Docs to have to track which files should be saved together, and take up more memory?


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log will show all of the previous commits from newest to oldest scrolling down. Git diff can be used to operate on two commit id's to compare them.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that might break something?
You wouldn't worry because you could easily find the version that broke something and then fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want a place to save and edit my app code.
