When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with others, or if you want to share it with other people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you want to decide when something is ready to be pulled, at logical checkpoints, and when they are ready.
