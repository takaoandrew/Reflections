When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with others, or if you want to share it with other people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you want to decide when something is ready to be pulled, at logical checkpoints, and when they are ready.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone from Github to github with references. Clones go to your local drive, and can come from github or local places. Branches are simply different versions of your code in your repository


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work on a project remotely, and use git diff to see how they differ


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would have to send files through e-mail, and almost everything would be harder.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Doing the changes in master is a lot easier, but if you mess up, you ruin master, so it is not as safe.
