What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You start tracking multiple files, which is helpful in the version control process


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is where you put commits before they become a part of the repository. I'm not sure of its value.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can compare your staging area to your most recent commit, to see how your next commit will be different (git diff --staged)


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

You could use them when you want your code to go in two separate directions, to track both directions separately.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

You can see what is reachable, and which file is a parent of another


What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Automatic is quicker, but may have conflicts.
